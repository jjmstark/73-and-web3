                                                                           73 and Web3


Project Background


Hello. My name is Martha Roth.   I am presenting this project to the ETHGlobal HackFS  that was held from July 6th to August 6th 2020. The goal of my project is to inform and promote the decentralized web also known as the Web3.   ETHGlobal’s HackFS is a hackathon focused on bringing together the Web3 community to help build the foundation of the decentralized ecosystem.

When I first got involved with HackFS, I had no idea what I was getting myself in for, but here I am, and I’m going to participate, and I will produce a project. I have participated in many of the presentations and workshops and office hours as I could.   I wanted to learn as much about the Web3 and the IPFS as I could.   I have some knowledge in these areas and Textile but wanted to become more than just superficially knowledgeable about them.  I also wanted to learn more about Filecoin, as well.   Because of the nature of the HackFS,  I have been able to become familiar with other entities of the IPFS such as Fleek,   	, and  	.	Since my abilities do not include any programming or app development,  I lean on the written word.  I want my project to reflect what I am learning and share it with community members who are not developers in hopes that they will become aware of and support Web3.   Although my target audience is those in my generation, there is nothing to say I can’t reach anybody of any age to become interested in Web3.   Since I am from a rural location, I understand the need to start involving kids before stepping out into the world.

In reflecting what my project would be it is pretty obvious that I won’t be developing an app but I can produce a blog.  Considering my age I felt that I would be better suited to address the older or retired community rather than a younger group.    To be honest, I may be able to remind you of some history in your lifetime and hopefully encourage you to learn about something going on right around you that is creating good.
 


 About the Author

Let me introduce myself.  I am by profession, a scientist.  About 50 years ago, I received a BS degree in biology and then worked for several years as a Lab Technician, Electron Microscopy Technician, Histology Technician, and Research Assistant for the Dartmouth Medical School Anatomy Department. I was involved in many research projects while there. After a number of years focused on helping with my three children grow up,  I owned and operated a greenhouse and garden shop in the local area.   I sent all my children off to discover their paths in this world.

My son was the only one of my children who delved into the world of science,  but with a twist,  by mixing science with computer programming and developing software to help in his various research projects.  In the last five years, he has shared his pursuit of making a positive change in our use of the internet. He became an avid proponent and developer in the decentralized ecosystem.  With his involvement came many twitters, blogs, reports, and presentations, which helped me take an interest in the decentralized web.

Historical context of Web3

To understand the present and the future, one must know and understand a bit of the past. When attempting to understand the history of Web3, I know that many of the components have emerged in my lifetime. Still, for others, it will appear as if it emerged from an entirely different reality.
 
The computer has only been around since the late 1930s.  Keep in mind that a good portion of the first 30 years of what we call the Computer Era consisted of engineers using mathematical concepts to develop machines that don’t look anything like the computer of today.  For some of us, we have to scratch our heads a bit as to why we call them part of the Computer Era.
    
To illustrate the difference between today's computers and early developments in the field, we can look at a few examples. 
           Bell's introduction was listed as an 'adder.' 
            HP developed the 200A, an audio oscillator 
            The Colossus, was developed in England to crack the German’s
                  Lorenze Cipher code in WWII.
              IBM's room size Harvard Mark 1 is a relay-based calculator
              MIT  builds a flight simulator to train bomber crews.
              Remington Rands introduced the ER101 for high-speed computing
               Standards Eastern Automatic computer had stored-program.
              Oliveti caught the eye of the public with its display at the New York
                    World's Fair of the Olivetti 101, which was said to be a
                    programmable calculator.
               Data General Corp introduced the Nova Mini Computer.  It had 32
                     KB of memory and sold for $8000
                IBM developed Scamp, their first computer system designed to run
                     the API programming language in a compact briefcase-like
                    enclosure, which comprised a keyboard, CRT display, and
                    cassette storage.

 A big game-changer came in the 70s with Intel's microprocessor.     We started seeing a lot of new computer developers regularly,  along with new and exciting changes.

Besides the computers, we had an evolution of the operating systems.  This gets into a technology that becomes more complex.  The first computers didn't have operating systems. Each program running had to include all the code needed to run the computer, communicate with the connected Hardware, and perform the program's calculation to complete each job.   It followed that software systems were developed to facilitate the writing and execute the operation of the program included with the computer. General Motors developed the first operating system that ran a single IBM Central Computer.   Unix developed Language C  which influenced  many operating systems, including Apple OS X, and different versions of Linux.   Microsoft was developed in response to a request by IBM for an operating system to use in their  PCs.  IBM would released a series of operating systems called OS and end up with the DOS for small systems.    These were followed by smaller computers featuring 8-bit processors, typically for MOS technology.  The microprocessor made inexpensive computing available for small businesses and hobbyists, and finally for the home.  Today there are three basic  operating systems in widespread use on personal computers: Apple Inc's Mac OS, open-source Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

There are a plethora of languages to be found.  Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notations.  The first computer codes were specialized for the each application. With limitations of some of the machines forcing programmers to create hand-tuned assembly language programs for them.  The first high-level programming language was Plankalkiil.  The first commercially available language was FORTRAN developed at IBM. Some other early languages still in use today are LISP and COROL. Other languages developed in through out the yeas are too numerous to list.
