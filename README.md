# 73-and-web3

A project encompassing a senior citizen's view of Web3 encompassing Filecoin, Textile and possibly  othere deevelopers.

## PlanningHow many people  have any knowledge or understanding of the decentralize web, and it's proponents such as Filecoin, Textile, etc?  For those participating this month, all of you.  For those out there especially my age, 73, probably not many.  My projecct will hopefully make it possible for those not involved  to have a better understanding and maybe get on board as supporters of this avenue into the future.  I have no experience in programming, coding, app development so I must choose another form to present my project  over the next few weeks.
